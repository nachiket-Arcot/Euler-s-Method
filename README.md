# Euler-s-Method

Approximates the y value of a function given an initial condition and differential equation using Euler's Method.
    
    Parameters: 

    x0: x value of the initial condition
    y0: y value of the initial condition
    x_f: Target x value that you want to approximate the y value of
    h: Step Size 

Purpose of this project was to approximate complex function values and repeating the process with a lower step size each time.
